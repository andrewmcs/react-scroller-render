# Task

You've learned about render props and how it's a viable alternative to higher-order components (HOCs) to encapsulate cross-cutting concerns. In a previous video, you saw a possible implementation of a mouse position tracker using higher-order components. In this exercise, you'll implement the same specifications but using a render prop component instead.
